# NexusGuard-Security
The NexusGuard Security application is a desktop security tool built with C# and Windows Forms. Its primary purpose is to scan files 
and folders on your computer to determine if they are malicious. It does this by communicating with VirusTotal, 
a powerful online service that analyzes files with dozens of different antivirus engines.

The application is designed to be user-friendly with a modern, themeable interface, while also being robust enough to handle errors 
and perform extensive system scans without crashing.

Core Features:
Multiple Scan Modes: You can scan a single file, an entire folder, or perform a full scan of your entire system.

Detailed Results: The application lists every file scanned, its status (Clean, Malicious, Unknown), the number of antivirus engines 
that detected it as a threat, and the date of the scan.

VirusTotal Integration: Leverages the powerful VirusTotal API to get accurate, up-to-date threat information.

File Quarantine System: Allows you to immediately isolate and neutralize detected threats.

Secure API Key Storage: Saves your VirusTotal API key between sessions by encrypting it and storing it securely in your user profile.

Light & Dark Themes: The user interface can be toggled between a light and dark mode for user comfort.

Exportable Reports: Scan results can be exported to a CSV file for logging or analysis.

Robust Error Handling: Designed to gracefully skip protected system files that it cannot access, allowing scans to complete without 
crashing.

How the Application is Structured (File by File)
The application is broken down into several C# files, each with a specific responsibility. This separation makes the code easier to
manage and understand.

Program.cs:

Role: The starting point. This is the first code that runs. Its only job is to start the main application window (Form1).

Form1.cs:

Role: The "brain" of the user interface. This file contains all the C# logic for the main window. It handles what happens when you
click a button (like "Scan File"), updates the progress bar and status label, and populates the results list.

Form1.Designer.cs:

Role: The visual blueprint of the main window. This file is automatically generated by the Visual Studio designer. It contains the 
code that creates and positions all the visual elements like buttons, labels, and the results list.

DetailForm.cs & DetailForm.Designer.cs:

Role: The pop-up window for viewing detailed results. When you double-click a result, this form appears, showing the file's hash and 
a list of the specific antivirus engines that flagged it.

VirusTotalScanner.cs:

Role: The bridge to the internet. This class is solely responsible for communicating with the VirusTotal API. 
Its process is:

Calculate a unique signature (a SHA256 hash) of a file.

Send that hash to VirusTotal's servers.

Receive the JSON response and parse it into a simple ScanResult object.

It also manages the API rate limit (4 requests per minute) to avoid being blocked.

FileSystemScanner.cs:

Role: The file finder. This class is responsible for crawling your computer's drives and folders to create a list of files to be scanned.
It is built to be resilient, with error handling that allows it to safely skip protected folders it doesn't have permission to access.

QuarantineManager.cs:

Role: The security guard. This class handles all the logic for quarantining a file. It knows how to safely move a file to a hidden,
secure location and rename it so it cannot be executed.

SettingsManager.cs:

Role: The application's memory. This class is responsible for saving the VirusTotal API key to a file and loading it when the app starts.
It uses Windows Data Protection to encrypt the key, so it isn't stored as plain text.

ScanResult.cs:

Role: The report card for a single file. This is a simple data class that holds all the information for one scan result 
(file path, status, detections, etc.).

ThemeColors.cs:

Role: The paint palette. This file defines the color schemes for the light and dark themes, making it easy to manage the
application's appearance.

The Quarantine Feature Explained:
Quarantining is the process of taking a potentially malicious file and moving it to a secure, isolated location where it 
cannot harm your system. It doesn't delete the file, but it effectively neutralizes it.

How it Works in This Application:
When you choose to quarantine a file, the QuarantineManager performs the following steps:

Moves the File: It takes the file from its original path (e.g., C:\Users\You\Downloads\badfile.exe).

Secures It: It moves the file to a hidden, protected folder located in your user profile: %AppData%\NexusGuard\Quarantine. 
This keeps it away from normal system operations.

Renames It: To prevent accidental execution, it renames the file with a .quarantined extension (e.g., badfile.exe.quarantined).

Creates a Manifest: It creates a small text file (.manifest) alongside the quarantined file that remembers the file's original location.
This would be used for a "restore" feature in the future.

How to Quarantine a File (Step-by-Step Guide):
Run a Scan: Perform a scan that detects a malicious file. The file will appear in the results list with a status of "Malicious" 
and will be highlighted in red.

Right-Click the File: Move your mouse over the malicious file in the results list and right-click it.

Select the Quarantine Option: A context menu will appear. Click on the "Quarantine File" option.

Confirm Your Choice: A confirmation dialog will pop up to ensure you don't quarantine a file by accident. Click "Yes".

Check the Result: The file will be immediately quarantined. In the results list, its status will change to "Quarantined",
and the row's background color will change to yellow for clear visual confirmation. The original file will no longer be in its 
previous location.
